I have created a Mac OS X Stats Bar Application that uses the API to keep a constant dashboard of your application's status in your screen's corner at all times.  
 - The icon changes color with your 'worst' application's health
 - Clicking the icon gives you a detailed view of all your applications and their current health
 - Plus, you can click the 'view' button to jump directly to the offending application's status page
 - It works with all the applications registered with your account.
